# HeartDisease_LogisticRegression
This project uses logistic regression to analyze the Framingham Heart Study dataset, a longitudinal study that tracks cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
The goal is to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using various health and lifestyle indicators, such as age, gender, smoking habits, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

**The project involves:**

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardizing features, and preparing data for model training.

Model Development: Building a logistic regression model to assess the relationship between features and CHD risk.

Model Evaluation: Using confusion matrices and accuracy scores to evaluate model performance on both training and test datasets.

Visualization: Creating visual insights into the dataset, including class distributions and model results.

This analysis aims to provide insights into key predictors of CHD and demonstrates a simple yet powerful approach to binary classification problems in healthcare.
